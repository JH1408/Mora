              Hi, I&apos;m Josy ðŸ‘‹
            </p>
            <Paragraph>
              Earlier this year (2025), I started learning Thai. To remember
              vocabulary, I was searching for a simple-to-use flashcard app, but
              everything I found was difficult to use, clunky, or didnâ€™t have
              the features I needed.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              So I decided to build my own tool with the features I needed:{' '}
              <span className='font-semibold text-text-primary'>
                handwriting support
              </span>{' '}
              (since I wasnâ€™t learning Thai script yet but used phonetic
              spelling with letters not on my keyboard),{' '}
              <span className='font-semibold text-text-primary'>
                audio output
              </span>{' '}
              (since Thai is a tonal language), and{' '}
              <span className='font-semibold text-text-primary'>
                spaced repetition
              </span>{' '}
              with front-to-back and back-to-front study modes.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              I figured if I was struggling to find the right tool, others might
              be too, so I made Mora to be something thatâ€™s easy to use and
              works the way language learners actually learn.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              Mora is still evolving, and Iâ€™d love to hear how youâ€™re using it
              or what features would help you learn better.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              Thanks for trying Mora! I hope it makes your language learning
              journey a little easier and a lot more enjoyable. ðŸ’œ
